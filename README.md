# Shared Worker
To see a working result please go directly to: https://antigone2.github.io/sharedWorkers/

In this example I would like to demonstrate, how to **share state**  between different pages, or opened windows.

In the moment the page is optimized only for Firefox web browser.

## Description
I have created a Shared Worker which do nothing but counts - after 0.5s ads 1.

I have created two web pages to demonstrate, that you can share state after going from one to another, or open new window.

If you stop/start worker in any window, or on any page, the counting stopes everywhere.
